// Package kar is an api for an lz4 backed file format.
// It's purpose is to be well suited for resource streaming resources
// from it. It's designed to be memory mapped, so (unlike tar) it knows
// where all the files are located before they're read. This nescesitates
// a bit of an unusual setup, where the archive itself is not compressed in
// any form, rather every file is individually compressed, so it could be immediately
// read from it's place and decompressed on the fly. This somewhat compromises
// space efficiency, but space efficiency is not the primary goal of this
// package. It instead focuses on getting resources from disk to a usable
// state as fast as possible. It can be read from concurrently.
