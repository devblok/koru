# Koru3D

At this stage, this project is merely my playground to try out Vulkan along
with a bunch of different things both in Go and technology in general.

Things to try (roughly in descending order of priority):
- [ ] Vulkan
- [x] [Packr](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr) (I was looking a nice go-bindata alternative for a while)
- [x] gotk3 GUI that's loaded from glade resources
- [x] One binary - whole engine (except maybe plugins)
- [ ] Support major platforms
- [ ] Try running the thing on Android
- [ ] Memory mapped resource packs
- [ ] Fully Lua scriptable
- [ ] A Plugin system
- [ ] Ability to run scripts on all cores
- [ ] Ability to run Vulkan rendering on all cores
- [ ] A nice, sufficient editor on gotk3
- [ ] An AI engine (experiment with neural networks too)
- [ ] Artificial intelligence that utilises GPU? [gorgonia](https://github.com/gorgonia/gorgonia)
- [ ] Design an actual game
